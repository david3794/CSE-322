	<h1> &#8220; Alone &#8221;   </h1>
	<hr>

<p>	From childhood's hour I have not been <br>
	As others were -- I have not seen <br>
	As others saw -- I could not bring <br>
	My <i>passions</i> from a common spring -- <br>
	From the same source I have not taken <br>
	My <b>sorrow</b> -- I could not awaken <br>
	My heart to joy at the same tone -- <br>
	And all I lov'd -- I lov'd alone -- <br>
	Then -- in my childhood -- in the dawn <br>
	Of a most <b>stormy</b> life -- was drawn <br>
	From ev'ry <i>depth</i> of good and ill <br>
	The mystery which binds me still -- <br>
 	From the torrent, or the fountain -- <br>
	From the red cliff of the mountain -- <br>
	From the sun that 'round me roll'd <br>
	In its autumn tint of gold -- <br>
	From the lightning in the sky <br>
	As it pass'd me flying by -- <br>
	From the thunder, and the storm -- <br>
 	And the cloud that took the form <br>
	(When the rest of Heaven was blue) <br>
	Of a demon in my view  <br>
